# Post Translational Modification Prediction 
Capstone project for Senior Year at Tulane University 

A full write up of using supervised learning and class imbalance methods can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yi3vMEq4l0SLw95HtiVRHsn010nrVaNZiZlV9pi7TjU/edit?usp=sharing 


The supervised methods generate precision and accuracy in the 80-90% range with recall in the 10-20% range.


Word2vec implementations are averaging around 75 in recall, precision, and accuracy for most post translational modifications tests.
